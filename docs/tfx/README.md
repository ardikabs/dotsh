# tfx

`tfx` (re: terraform script) is a thin wrapper script for Terraform to work with multiple directories of terraform files.
It shares similar objectives with Terragrunt, but instead of introducing another layer of abstraction like `terragrunt.hcl`, it transparently manages Terraform across multiple directories, simplifying the process.

## Usage

`tfx` incorporates core commands from Terraform such as:

- `tfx validate`: This command checks the syntax of the Terraform files, ensuring they are correctly structured before any plan or apply operation.
- `tfx plan`: This command creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state defined in the Terraform files.
- `tfx apply`: This command applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a `tfx` plan execution.
- `tfx version`: This command shows the current versions of both `tfx` and `terraform` that `tfx` uses.

Unlike running commands directly in the Terraform resource directory, `tfx` is designed to be executed from the root directory of the git repository. It scans the entire repository, identifies directories containing Terraform files, and labels them as ADDED, MODIFIED, or DELETED.
